A little and simple yet (hopefully ! ) fun game. The game is made with python 3.5+ and Pygame 1.8.0 (should work with following versions).

__Development History__:
I started coding this game while bored, it has no real purpose aside from giving fun to the players ! I do not spend a lot of time coding it so don't expect any regular update. 
If you are intersted in helping in the development please write to me. Also please feel free to send advices and recomendations. They will all be taken into consideration. NOTICE: If you are an artist and are interested in making custom sprites for this game you will be welcome !

__The Game__:
The game is a multiplayer shared screen. The players all compete in a small arena and must be the last one standing in order to win. Teammatches are planned although I have not started working on them yet.

**BEWARE** The game is in early development and currently non-functionnal.

__How to Play__:
The game is played with 5 keys. Three to move up, left and right. Then one to pickup items and another to shoot. The last one is meant to crouch although this function has not been implemented in the alpha yet.
The final version will contain a settings screen which will enable ti cutomize the keymaps. The defaults are as follow:
