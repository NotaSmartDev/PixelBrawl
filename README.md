# PixelBrawl
A little and simple yet (hopefully ! ) fun game. The game is made with python 3.7+ and Pygame 1.9.4 (should work with following versions).

## Development History:
I got the idea of coding a game in python a few months ago when I couldn't think of anything else new and entertaining to write. Moreover I thought I'd be a good way to play a simple game with some members of my family & friends. Hopefully you will have fun with it too ! I do not spend a lot of time coding it though so don't expect any regular update. To code this game I first had to get some knowledge on the [Pygame](https://pygame.org/) module. I mostly read the official documentation to learn how to use pygame. I also used [this template](https://github.com/kidscancode/pygame_tutorials/blob/master/pygame%20template.py) to begin my game. I want to thank [KidsCanCode](https://github.com/kidscancode/) [(LISCENCE)](https://github.com/kidscancode/pygame_tutorials/LICENSE) for this much apreciated time saving help ! 
If you are intersted in helping in the development please write to me. Also please feel free to send advices and recomendations. They will all be taken into consideration. *NOTICE: If you are an artist and are interested in making custom sprites for this game you will be welcome !*

## The Game:
The game is a multiplayer shared screen. The players all compete in a small arena and must be the last one standing in order to win. Teammatches are planned although I have not started working on them yet.

**BEWARE** The game is in early development and currently barely functionnal. Use at your own risk.

## Instructions:

### Installation:

##### Without python:

If you'r under Linux you can just download the version you want by following this link. The Mega folder contains all versions compiled for Linux. I haven't compiled any version for windows so you'll probably have to wait until the full release to get it unless anyone ask for it before that. Meanwhile refer to the next section to get the game.

Once you have the compiled version downloaded simply extract its contents (if compressed) and run onto the binary file (the one called `PixelBrawl-ALPHA`). That's it ! I hope you enjoy. Don't hesitate to give me your feedback !

##### With python:

If you have the python interpreter installed all you have to do is to download the source code of the latest stable (`v0.3-a3`) or experimental (`master-branch`) version. Extract the source code into a directory then open a terminal (or command prompt under windows) in the directory and type:

- UNIX: `python3 main.py`
- Windows: `py main.py`

That's it ! I hope you enjoy. Don't hesitate to give me your feedback !



### How to play:

The game is played with 5 keys. Three to move up, left and right. Then one to pickup items and another to shoot. The last one is meant to crouch although this function has not been implemented in the alpha yet.
The final version will contain a settings screen which will enable players to cutomize the keymaps.
