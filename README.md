# PixelBrawl
A little and simple yet (hopefully ! ) fun game. The game is made with python 3.5+ and Pygame 1.8.0 (should work with following versions).
I started coding this game while bored, it has no real purpose aside from giving fun to the players ! I do bot spend a lot of time coding it
if you are intersted in helping in the development please write to me. Also please feel free to send advices and recomendations. They will all be taken into consideration.
The game is a multiplayer shared screen. The players all compete in a small arena and must be the last one standing in order to win. Teammatches are planned although I have not started working on them yet.

**BEWARE** The game is in early development and currently non-functionnal.

NOTICE: If you are an artist and are interested in making custom sprites for this game you will be welcome !
